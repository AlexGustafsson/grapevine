# Grapevine

Grapevine dead simple self-hosted, fast and secure app-less push notification
service that works on iOS.

Grapevine's useful when you easily want to get push notifications to your phone,
without trusting an App Store app, or paying the Apple Tax to run your own app
on your own device.

In addition, Grapevine uniquely allows for customizable app names and icons,
offering you more customizability and compartmentalization.
